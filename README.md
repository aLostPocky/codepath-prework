## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
    •    App 1: YouTube
    ◦    Miniplayer feature
    ◦    Download videos
    ◦    Screencast any video onto your TV
    •    App 2: Chrome
    ◦    Autofill Saved Information feature
    ◦    Get rid of inactive tabs
    ◦    Googling directly from address bar
    •    App 3: Spotify
    ◦    Seamlessly allow friends input songs in joint session
    ◦    Lyrics to songs
    ◦    Easily find your music taste via algorithm
    •    App 4: Messenger
    ◦    Share multiple photos at once in chat with friends
    ◦    Being able to see when friends are online or offline
    ◦    Being able to express yourself with emoji/gif/stickers
## App Idea
    •    App: Swap
    ◦    Group storage for exchanging unchanged quality pictures with friends
    ◦    Has a built-in calendar to mark dates of when pics were taken.
    ◦    Users can input their availabilities on calendar to let public/friends/specific people know.
    •    I have always struggled to find an app that would allow my friends and I to better plan
our hangouts including everyone's availability. And during the hangouts, we would take photos 
but the photos would lose quality when sent through apps like Messenger. I just want an app that
would be all in one place. These are the initial features for now but I look forward to adding more.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
